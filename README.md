# AR-Pong

AR-Pong is a game developed for the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hardware) and is based on the classic game [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong). In this game, two players duke it out by trying to bounce a ball into their opponent's goal, a hitbox that follows their head.

The game is built using Unity and the [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) from Microsoft.
